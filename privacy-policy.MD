# Privacy Policy
Matthew Doles built the Whose Tagline Is It Anyway app as a free Alexa Skill with in-skill purchases. This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service. I also advise you to consult the Privacy Policies by the Amazon Digital Services LLC (with its affiliates, “Amazon”) for more information. 

### Information Collection and Use

In no way do I, or this skill, collect any identifiable information. Any potential information collected will be through Aamzon to process any in-skill purchases. The app also does not use any third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update the Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page. Your continued use of our skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
