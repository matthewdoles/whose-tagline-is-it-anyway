Invocation: whose tagline is it anyway

### Skill Description

In Whose Tagline Is It Anyway, you will be given the tagline for a random movie from a pool of 1,500 semi-popular movies. From that, you must deduce what movie the tagline is for. There is also an additional in-skill product: Good Word Hunting. In this game, you will be given up to 5 keywords associated with a random movie. With those keywords, you will then be asked how many cast members from lowest billed to highest would you need to guess what the movie is.
